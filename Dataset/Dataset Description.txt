Dataset Name : Employee Career Advancement Prediction Data
Summary : The company faces challenges in determining which employees are eligible for promotion. Traditionally, promotion decisions have often been subjective, relying heavily on manual evaluations by managers. This approach can lead to bias, lack of transparency, and the potential loss of high-performing employees. By leveraging historical employee data, the company can build a classification model to predict promotion eligibility based on factors such as performance, experience, leadership, and participation in training or projects.
Goals : Identifying the most influential factors in promotion decisions and building a classification prediction model using supervised learning to predict which employees are eligible for promotion.
